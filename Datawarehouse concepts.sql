Datawarehouse concepts : 

The term "data warehouse architecture data design" encompasses several layers. We can break it down into three main 
categories:

	1.Overall Architectural Styles (How the entire system is structured)
	2.Data Modeling Techniques (How data is structured inside the warehouse)
	3.Data Design Patterns (How data flows and is processed)

1. Overall Architectural Styles

These are high-level blueprints for the entire data ecosystem.

	a. Traditional Monolithic Architecture (Inmon Approach)
		Concept: The data warehouse is the central, integrated, subject-oriented, time-variant, and non-volatile core 
		of the corporate information factory. Data is ingested from source systems into a normalized relational model 
		(the "Enterprise Data Warehouse" or EDW). From there, data marts are created as logical or physical subsets 
		for specific business units.

		Key Characteristic: Top-down approach. Focus on a single source of truth and data integration before delivering
				to data marts.

		Pros: Highly consistent, integrated data; minimizes data redundancy.

		Cons: Can be slow and expensive to build and change; requires significant upfront design.

	b. Dimensional Data Mart Bus Architecture (Kimball Approach)
	
		Concept: The data warehouse is the union of all its dimensional data marts. The architecture starts by building 
		conformed, dimensionally modeled data marts directly from source systems. These marts are integrated via 
		conformed dimensions (e.g., a common Date or Customer table used across all marts), which creates the "bus" 
		that ties them together.

		Key Characteristic: Bottom-up approach. Focus on delivering business value quickly through iterative data mart 
		development.

		Pros: Faster delivery of tangible results; highly understandable and performant for queries.

		Cons: Can lead to redundancy and inconsistency if conformed dimensions are not managed strictly.

	c. Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
	
		Concept: This is a hybrid model that often incorporates both Inmon and Kimball ideas. Source data is first 
		landed in a staging area. It is then integrated and transformed into a normalized EDW (the "Hub"). 
		Finally, data is propagated to various dimensional data marts (the "Spokes") for consumption.

		Key Characteristic: Balances the need for a central integrated repository with the need for high-performance, 
		business-specific access layers.

	d. Modern Cloud-Based Architecture (The Data Lakehouse)
	
	  - Concept: This newer architecture leverages low-cost cloud storage (Data Lakes) but adds a management and design 
		layer on top to bring warehouse-like capabilities (ACID transactions, schema enforcement, performance).

		Data Lake: Stores all data—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured—in its raw form.

		Medallion Architecture: A common design pattern within a Lakehouse:

			Bronze Layer: Raw landed data (as-is copy of the source).

			Silver Layer: Cleaned, filtered, and integrated data (a single source of truth).

			Gold Layer: Data aggregated and modeled into business-level schemas (dimensional models for consumption).

	 - Key Characteristic: Decouples storage from compute, allows for advanced use cases (ML, AI on raw data), and is 
		highly scalable and cost-effective.

	 - Pros: Extreme scalability, cost-efficiency for storage, supports all data types.

	 - Cons: Can become a "data swamp" without strong governance; complexity of managing multiple tools.

2. Data Modeling Techniques

This defines how tables and relationships are structured within a layer of the architecture.

a. Third Normal Form (3NF) / Normalized

	Purpose: To eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity for transactional systems. This is the classic 
	   design for the central EDW in the Inmon approach.

	Structure: Data is broken down into many tables with specific relationships (e.g., one-to-many). For example, 
	   customer data might be split into Customer, Address, Contact_Number tables.

	Best for: The "single source of truth" integration layer where the focus is on efficient storage and capturing 
	   complex relationships, not on query performance.

b. Dimensional Modeling

	Purpose: To optimize data for querying and analysis in a data mart. This is the heart of the Kimball approach.

	Structure: Uses two types of tables:

	Fact Tables: Contain the measurable, quantitative data about a business process (e.g., sales_amount, quantity_sold). 
	  They are the center of the star schema.

	Dimension Tables: Contain descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts (e.g., Product, Customer, Time, 
	Store). They surround the fact table.

	Best for: The presentation / consumption layer where business intelligence tools and analysts need fast, intuitive 
	query performance.

c. Data Vault Modeling

	Purpose: To provide a flexible, scalable, and auditable model for the raw data integration layer. It''s designed 
	for agile data warehouse development.

	Structure: Uses three core table types:

	Hubs: Represent a core business key (e.g., Customer_ID).

	Links: Represent a transaction or association between business keys (e.g., a link between a Customer_ID and an 
	Account_ID).

	Satellites: Contain all the descriptive attributes and history for a Hub or Link.

	Best for: The EDW integration layer in agile environments where sources change frequently, and you need to track 
	all history without remodeling.

3. Data Design Patterns (How Data is Processed)

a. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

	Concept: Data is transformed before it is loaded into the target data warehouse.

	Use Case: Traditional data warehousing where the target system requires clean, structured, and ready-to-query data.
	Puts the load on the source or staging server.

b. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

	Concept: Data is extracted and loaded into the target storage (e.g., a Data Lake or cloud DWH) in its raw form. 
	Transformations are then executed inside the powerful target system.

	Use Case: Modern cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift) and data lakehouses where compute is 
	scalable and separate from storage. Offers greater flexibility.

In practice, a modern data stack often combines these elements. For example, you might:

	Ingest data into a Data Lake (Lakehouse architecture).	Model the raw data in a Data Vault for integration.

	Transform the integrated data into a Dimensional Model for consumption (ELT pattern).
	Use a Hub-and-Spoke style to manage the flow.
